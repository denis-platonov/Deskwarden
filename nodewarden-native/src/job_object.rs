//! A Windows Job Object configured with `JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`.
//!
//! `bw serve` holds an unlocked vault and serves it over plain HTTP on
//! localhost. Killing it only on the tray's Quit path is not enough: a panic,
//! a Ctrl+C, or a Task Manager kill of `nodewarden-native` leaves it running
//! and serving decrypted secrets with nothing left to stop it.
//!
//! A job object with kill-on-close moves that guarantee into the kernel. Every
//! process assigned to the job is terminated when the last handle to the job
//! closes -- and the OS closes our handles unconditionally when this process
//! dies, whatever the reason (including `process::exit`, which skips
//! destructors, and an unhandled panic or an external `TerminateProcess`).
